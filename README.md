## Minimum Spanning Tree by Kruskal's Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The algorithm is implemented in python

### Usage

The algorithm is implemented in the file `Graph.py`. The file `Plot.py` is implemented each step for drawing spanning tree .The file `App.py` contains a simple example of how to use the algorithm.
